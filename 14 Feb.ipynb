    "### 1] Increased complexity:     \n",
    "#### Multithreading can increase the complexity of a program, making it more difficult to understand, debug, and maintain.\n",
    "### 2]Synchronization issues:    \n",
    "#### Multithreading can introduce synchronization issues, such as race conditions and deadlocks, which can cause unpredictable behavior and make it difficult to ensure the correctness of the program.\n",
    "### 3] Resource contention:     \n",
    "#### Multithreading can lead to resource contention, where multiple threads compete for the same resources, such as memory or I/O devices. This can result in reduced performance or even program failure.\n",

This can happen when two threads each hold a resource that the other thread needs to continue, or when one thread is waiting for a resource that another thread is holding indefinitely. Deadlocks can cause a program to hang indefinitely and can be difficult to detect and resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Race condition: \n",
    "#### A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data or resources in an unpredictable order, leading to unexpected results or program behavior. For example, if two threads try to update the same variable at the same time, the result may depend on which thread executes first. Race conditions can cause bugs and other program errors, and can be difficult to diagnose and reproduce."
