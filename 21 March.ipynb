    "# 1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you might choose one over the other.\n",
    "### --> Both Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are techniques used in machine learning to represent categorical data as numerical data. The difference between these two techniques is in how they assign numerical values to categorical values.\n",
    "### --> Label Encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category in the data. For example, if we have a categorical variable 'color' with three categories 'red', 'green' and 'blue', then Label Encoding will assign numerical values like 0, 1, and 2 respectively to each of these categories.\n",
    "### --> Ordinal Encoding, on the other hand, assigns numerical values based on the order or rank of the categories. For example, if we have a categorical variable 'education' with categories 'high school', 'college', and 'graduate', then Ordinal Encoding may assign numerical values like 1, 2, and 3, respectively, where the order reflects the education level."

    "# 2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in a machine learning project.\n",
    "### --> Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the relationship between their categories and the target variable in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### --> The process works by replacing the categories with a numerical value that represents their relationship with the target variable. In Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, the categories are ordered in ascending order based on their mean target value. The first category gets assigned the value 1, the second category gets assigned the value 2, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### --> For example, let's say we have a dataset with a categorical variable \"City\" and a binary target variable \"Is_Booked\". The \"City\" variable has four categories: \"New York\", \"Boston\", \"Chicago\", and \"San Francisco\". We can apply Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to encode the \"City\" variable using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step1: Calculate the mean target value for each category:\n",
    "#### City\t        Is_Booked_mean\n",
    "#### New York\t     0.75\n",
    "#### Boston\t         0.60\n",
    "#### Chicago\t     0.55\n",
    "#### San Francisco\t 0.40\n",

    "# 3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "### -->Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two variables. It indicates how much two variables change together. If the covariance between two variables is positive, it means that when one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase. If the covariance is negative, it means that when one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease.\n",
    "### --> Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it provides a way to measure the degree of association between two variables. By understanding the covariance between variables, we can determine whether they are related, and if so, how strongly. It can also be used to identify patterns in data and to make predictions based on those patterns.\n",
    "### The formula for covariance is: cov(X,Y) = (1/n) âˆ‘(xi - mean(X)) * (yi - mean(Y))\n",
    "### Where X and Y are two variables, n is the number of observations, xi and yi are the individual observations, and mean(X) and mean(Y) are the means of X and Y, respectively.\n",
    "### Covariance can also be standardized to produce a correlation coefficient, which is a more interpretable measure of the relationship between two variables. Correlation coefficients range from -1 to +1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation."
