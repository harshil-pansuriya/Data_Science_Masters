    "## What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "### --> Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression method that combines two popular regularization techniques, Lasso regression and Ridge regression. It aims to overcome the limitations of these methods by striking a balance between them.\n",
    "### --> In Lasso regression, the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients is added to the objective function to constrain the magnitude of the coefficients. This has the effect of shrinking some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection. In Ridge regression, the sum of the squares of the coefficients is added to the objective function, which also constr"

Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into training and validation sets and repeatedly fitting the model on different subsets of the training set and testing the model on the validation set.\n",

    "### 1] Split the dataset into training and validation sets.\n",

    "### 3] Fit the Elastic Net Regression model using different combinations of alpha and l1_ratio, and evaluate the model's performance on the validation set using a metric such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.\n",

    "## How do you interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "### --> Interpreting the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression can be a bit more complex than in regular linear regression due to the presence of two regularization parameters, alpha and l1_ratio. However, the interpretation is still straightforward once you understand the effects of these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### --> The coefficients in Elastic Net Regression represent the change in the response variable that is associated with a one-unit increase in the corresponding predictor variable, holding all other predictor variables constant. The magnitude of the coefficient represents the strength and direction of the association between the predictor variable and the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### --> The effect of the regularization parameters, alpha and l1_ratio, on the coefficients depends on the specific values of these parameters. Generally, increasing alpha will increase the amount of regularization and shrink the coefficients towards zero, while increasing l1_ratio will increase the relative strength of the Lasso penalty and lead to sparser coefficient estimates "

    "### 2] Imputation: Another approach is to impute missing values with estimates based on the available data. There are many methods for imputation, such as mean imputation, regression imputation, and k-nearest neighbor imputation.

    "### 4] Use a hybrid approach: It is possible to combine deletion and imputation to handle missing data. For example, if the amount of missing data is small, one can delete the observations with missing data and impute the missing values in the remaining data."

Typically, a range of alpha values and a few l1_ratio values are chosen for cross-validation.\n",
