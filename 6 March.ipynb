    "#### 1] Mean: The arithmetic mean is the sum of all the data values divided by the total number of data points. The mean provides a measure of the typical value of the data set.\n",

    "#### 3] Mode: The mode is the most frequent value in a data set. It is useful when the data set contains categorical variables or when there is more than one peak in the distribution.\n",

    "### Common measures of variability include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1] Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a data set. It gives an indication of how spread out the data are.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2] Variance: The variance is a measure of how spread out the data are from the mean. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each data point and the mean, divided by the total number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3] Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average distance between each data point and the mean. A larger standard deviation indicates a greater degree of variability in the data set."
