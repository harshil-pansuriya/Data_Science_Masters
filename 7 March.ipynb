    "### 2] Median: The median is the middle value of a set of numbers. To find the median, you arrange the numbers in order from smallest to largest and then choose the middle number. If there is an even number of numbers, you take the average of the two middle numbers.\n",

In general, the mean is used when the data is normally distributed and has no extreme values, the median is used when the data is skewed or has extreme values, and the mode is used when the data is categorical or nominal. However, it is always important to consider the characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the analysis when choosing the appropriate measure of central tendency."
